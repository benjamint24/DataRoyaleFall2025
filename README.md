Clash Royale Season 18 Deck Meta Analysis

This project analyzes match data from 16 million games of Clash Royale Season 18 (December 2020). We aggregated the data by deck to determine the number of unique decks and to generate performance statistics such as:

Total wins

Total losses

Matches played

Win rate

The goal of the project is to uncover the cards and combinations that performed the best during the season and to give players a way to explore the meta themselves.
